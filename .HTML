Global Warming.

</font></h1>


<br>Global warming is the observed century-scale rise in the average temperature of Earth's

climate system.

<br>

Since the early 20th century, the global air and sea surface temperature has increased

about 0.8°C (1.4 °F), with about two-thirds of the increase occurring since 1980.
